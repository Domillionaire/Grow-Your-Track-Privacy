  <h2>Information You Provide</h2>

  <h2>AI Features and Processing (OpenAI)</h2>

    When you use AI-powered features (such as lyrics generation), relevant text inputs are sent to our server and then forwarded to <strong>OpenAI</strong> to generate a response.

    We do not require you to provide personal identifying information (such as name or email) to use AI features.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Please do not include sensitive personal information in AI prompt fields.</strong></p>
  <p>
    OpenAI may retain API data for up to 30 days for safety monitoring and abuse prevention, after which it is deleted. OpenAI does not use API data to train its models.

  <p><strong>Operational logs:</strong><br />
