  <h1>Privacy Policy — Grow Your Track</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-05</p>

  <p>Grow Your Track respects your privacy. This policy explains what information is processed when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No account or sign-up is required.</li>
    <li>Projects, arrangements, and recordings are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li>If you use AI features (lyrics generation), your inputs are sent to our server and to OpenAI to generate results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information you provide</h2>
  <p><strong>Project inputs</strong><br>
  You may enter text such as genre, mood, energy, lyric direction, and lyrics. These inputs are used to generate lyric results inside the app.</p>

  <p><strong>Feedback (optional)</strong><br>
  If you use the in-app feedback feature, we receive the message text you submit. The feedback form does not require personal information.</p>

  <h2>Audio &amp; microphone</h2>
  <p>The app requests microphone access only when you choose to record voice notes or vocal takes. Recordings are stored locally on your device unless you choose to share/export them.</p>

  <h2>AI features and processing (OpenAI)</h2>
  <p>When you use AI-powered features (lyrics generation), relevant text inputs are sent to our servers for processing and are then sent to <strong>OpenAI</strong> to generate a response.</p>
  <p>We do not require you to provide personal identifying information (such as your name or email) to use AI features.</p>
  <p><strong>Please do not include personal or sensitive information in AI prompt fields.</strong></p>
  <p>OpenAI may retain processed data for up to 30 days for safety monitoring, after which it is deleted. OpenAI does not use API data to train its models</p>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device:</strong> Projects, arrangements, and recordings are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>On our servers:</strong> We do not maintain user accounts and we do not intentionally store your projects, lyrics, or recordings on our servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Operational note:</strong> Our server is hosted on Replit. Like most hosting platforms, Replit and our server infrastructure may generate basic operational logs (for example, error logs and request metadata) for reliability and security. These logs are not used for advertising.</p>

  <h2>Tracking and advertising</h2>
  <p>Grow Your Track does not use third-party advertising SDKs and does not include analytics tracking SDKs.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>If you choose to share/export a final mix using iOS sharing, that content is shared through services you select and is subject to those services’ privacy practices.</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Grow Your Track is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If we change this policy, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.</p>
